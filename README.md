## 🚀 About Me

I’m an aspiring software developer with a strong focus on **AI-powered solutions** and **data-driven applications**. I enjoy building tools that make a difference—whether it’s helping people see colors differently, track their fitness, or engage in creative storytelling.

When I’m not coding, I’m either managing an Esports team, tinkering with hardware projects, or exploring new technologies like embedded systems, 3D printing, and robotics.
